(** This module contains functions to handle unsolicited server to
    client communication on the client side *)

(** when the page is not active the client stops making comet requests
    to the server, implying that the client can't be notified by the
    server anymore. The activity status is changed when the page is
    focused or unfocused.

    To stop receiving inputs from a channel, use Lwt.cancel on a
    thread waiting for datas. For instance, if you iterate with
    [ let t = Lwt_stream.iter f %channel ] calling [Lwt.cancel t]
    will close the channel. *)

val is_active : unit -> bool
(** [is_active ()] returns the current activity state *)

val activate : unit -> unit
(** if the client is inactive [activate ()] launch a new xhr
    connection to start receiving server messages *)

val active_until_timeout : bool -> unit
(** [active_until_timeout v] sets the activity changing behaviour. if
    [v] is [true] the page is kept active even if not focused until the
    client receive a timeout message from the server. It implies that
    if the server keeps sending datas to the client, the comet
    connection will never be closed *)

val always_active : bool -> unit
(** [always_active true] tells the client to always stay active *)

(**/**)

val unwrap : 'a Eliom_common_comet.chan_id Eliom_client_types.data_key -> 'a Lwt_stream.t
val register : 'a Eliom_common_comet.chan_id -> 'a Lwt_stream.t

val restart : unit -> unit
(** [restart ()] Restarts the loop waiting for server messages. It is
    only usefull after that a formulary is sent. Indeed browsers stops
    all xhr requests in that case. It is normaly not needed, but some
    brosers (based on webkit) also destroy the xhr object in that
    case, preventing client code from receiving the failure
    notification. This shouldn't be used by average user. *)

val close : 'a Eliom_common_comet.chan_id -> unit
(** [close c] closes the channel c. This function should be only use
    internaly. The normal way to close a channel is to cancel a thread
    waiting on inputs. *)
